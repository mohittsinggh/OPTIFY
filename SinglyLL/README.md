# Linked List Operations in C++

## Overview

This C++ program demonstrates the implementation of a singly linked list with various operations. The program allows users to perform insertions, deletions, and other manipulations on the linked list. The available operations include adding nodes at different positions, removing nodes, reversing the list, and searching for elements.

## Features

- **Insertions**:
  - **At Head**: Add a new node at the beginning of the list.
  - **At Tail**: Add a new node at the end of the list.
  - **At Specific Position**: Insert a new node at a specified position.

- **Deletions**:
  - **At Head**: Remove the first node from the list.
  - **At Tail**: Remove the last node from the list.
  - **At Specific Position**: Remove a node from a specified position.
  - **Entire List**: Delete all nodes from the list.

- **Other Operations**:
  - **Display**: Print the contents of the list.
  - **Reverse**: Reverse the order of nodes in the list.
  - **Find Middle**: Find and display the middle element of the list.
  - **Search**: Search for a specific value and display its position.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Basic understanding of C++ and linked list data structures

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Compile the Program**:
   ```sh
   g++ -o linked_list linked_list.cpp
